# programming-for-data-analysis-project
Programming for Data Analysis Project @ GMIT 2021

Project Overview:
For this project, you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing.
You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life.
Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),
but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.

Introduction:
As a gamer, I have picked the real-world phenomenon of video gaming and how video game prices can fluctuate through regular online sales available to gamers.
I have decided to focus specifically on my own video game collection, ranging from PlayStation all the way through to PlayStation 5.
I constructed this dataset a number of years ago to examine my own spending habits on video games, and to analyse whether I purchased games via online sales rather than paying full retail price.
I divided games in my Excel file into each console I have played (PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, PSVR, PS VITA and PSP), online receipts in my Gmail displayed the savings if applicable.
If savings were made, I would enter the full price, followed by sale price, followed by savings.
